Dog Emotions Detector

My project is an attempt to have the ResNet-18 AI model to be able to recognize a dog's feelings. It is able to take a picture of a dog and return an emotion from angry, happy, relaxed and sad.

## The Algorithm

Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here. 

This project uses the ResNet-18 AI model, which is a convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million images in the ImageNet database. This model is an image detecting software, so it can also be re-trained with a separate database for a different output. 

## Running this project
